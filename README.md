# Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

This repository contains a guide to solving the ['Bioinformatics module mini project' posted by BioinformHER](https://github.com/BioinformHER/Module-1-Mini-Project/tree/main). The project was originally part of an internship challenge that has since concluded, so the main purpose of solving this mini project now is to hone my bioinformatics skills.

**Objective:** Download, analyze, and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene, which encode a proinflammatory cytokine call TNF.

<br/>

**Overview:** Perform a series of bioinformatics tasks using the human TNF gene as your sequence of interest. The project will consist of downloading the sequence, translating it, finding ORFs, analyzing sequence composition, identifying transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding/non-coding regions, and converting sequence file 
formats.
